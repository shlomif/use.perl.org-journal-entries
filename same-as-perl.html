<h1>2008-04-01: The Problem with the &quot;Same Terms as Perl&quot; 
Licencing</h1>

<p>
Most modules on CPAN carry a licensing blurb saying something like
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=%22same%20terms%20as%20perl%22&amp;mode=all">"you can distribute this software under 
the same terms as Perl itself"</a>. This obviously begs the question what
does it mean. Here is what it means for different Perl versions:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
Early versions of perl, before it adopted the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GPL</a> were under a very restrictive 
loosely-defined licence.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
After a while perl adopted the GPL exclusively.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Eventually, seeing that some people and companies had problems with the GPL,
Larry Wall phrased the so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_License">"Artistic License"</a>, which was supposed to be more permissive than 
the GPL, but purposely phrased vaguley, and as such was found to be 
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/index_html#ArtisticLicense">non-free</a> 
and ergo GPL-incompatible.
</p>

<p>
In any case, the perl implementation was dual-licensed under the "Artistic 
License" (version unspecified) and the GPL version 2 or any later version.
perl5 is still licensed under these terms.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
For Parrot and for future work on Perl 6, the Artistic License 2.0 was created
based on the original Artistic License. This license has been approved as
a free software licence by the Free Software Foundation and found to be 
compatible with the GPL version 2 or Later. Parrot now carries this licence.
</p>

<p>
There's also the Clarified Artistic License which is an earlier effort
to correct the original Artistic License and is the minimal set of 
changes to make it FSF-free and GPL-compatible. I suppose that now the Artistic
License 2.0 would be preferable.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The problem is that perl up to and including perl-5.10.0 and bleadperl 
(which were licensed under the GPL version 2 
<b>or above</b> but only the "Artistic License" not the "Artistic License
version 1.0 or above". I've already noted that the Artistic License is
problematic, but the GPL has 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Criticism">its
own share of potential problems</a> (see also 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html">its FAQ</a>), and is
otherwise widely mis-understood, over-hyped (both positively and negatively)
and disputed. For example, unlike the Artistic License, it does not allow
(at least by linking or normal function calls) non-GPL-compatible code,
including all non-open-source code, to make use of it.
</p>

<p>
Now, since both the "GPL version 2 or above" and the original 
"Artistic License" are problematic, and the term "under the same terms as
Perl" may probably mean just that if it's a perl5 module (although who knows
what it would means if someone would ever write a compatible Perl 5 
implementation under a different software licence), then licensing a module
as such is probably no longer such a good idea. There are several alternatives: 
</p>

<ol>

<li>
Explicitly allow the Artistic License 2.0 (or possibly above) in the
licensing.
</li>

<li>
License as Artistic 2.0 or above exclusively. Without the GPL as it is
generally no longer needed.
</li>

<li>
Use a more permissive, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">non-copyleft</a> licence,
that allows re-licensing into different licences. The MIT X11 licence 
explicitly allows "sub-licencing" by third-parties and as such is a good 
choice. By doing that you are making the licence more permissive than the
GPL or the Artistic licences, so you have been warned.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
So my suggestion is that you use one of these licencing phrasings for your
future work, and to re-license your old CPAN or Perl work 
(copyright ownership permitting) under such phrasing. It remains to be seen
what will happen with perl5 itself which has 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/RGARCIA/perl-5.10.0/AUTHORS">905 authors 
as of perl-5.10.0</a> many bringing in their own ownerships of the code.
The Linux kernel now faces a similar problem if it would wish to adopt
a different licence than the GPL version 2 (and no later version).
</p>

<p>
I suppose you can still make most use of perl5-like licensed code, in
your own open-source , proprietary or in-house code, without getting sued, so I 
wouldn't worry too much. But it's still would be a good
idea to convert newer code (and code that can be easily converted) to 
licensing terms that are less ambigious, more usable, and that would play
better with future versions of Perl.
</p>

<p>
This entry was adapted from 
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~Aristotle/journal/36022">some 
comments I wrote</a> for a different, mostly orthogonal, journal post. I
hope it's not too flamebait. If you have something to say, please try to
be civil and good-natured.
</p>

<p>
For the record, most of my Perl and non-Perl open-source code is either
Public Domain or MIT X11-licensed (which are both extremely permissive and
allow sub-licensing), or if it is derived from a different code, then
under the same licencing terms, but while disclaiming my explicit or implicit
ownership (to allow the originator to relicence future versions of the code).
The latter applies to my (relatively limited) contributions to perl5 where I am
listed in the AUTHORS file.
