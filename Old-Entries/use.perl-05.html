<p>
The slides for three new short Perl-related presentations I prepared
<a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/cat/lightning-talks/">are
    available on my site</a>:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Lightning/Opt-Multi-Task-in-PDL/">Optimising
        Multi-Tasking using PDL</a> which shows how to implement an
    optimisation of several game AI scans, in the
    <a href="http://pdl.perl.org/">Perl Data Language</a> for speed
    and flexibility.
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Lightning/Test-Run/">Test::Run -
        a new and improved test harness</a> - a presentation about Test::Run,
    which aims to be the successor for Test::Harness. (And which
    <a href="http://use.perl.org/~Shlomi+Fish/journal/27887">was mentioned
        here before</a>.)
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Lightning/Too-Many-Ways/">There
        are too many ways to do it</a> - a certain task and the various
    solutions that people came up with to solve it.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
I prepared all of them for
<a href="http://www.osdc.org.il/">OSDC::Israel::2006</a>, but ended up giving
only the Test::Run one.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy!
