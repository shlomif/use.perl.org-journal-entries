We didn't have a bugtracker at work, and since we needed it pretty badly, I
volunteered to install <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">bugzilla</a>. After
I got the root password, I was able to start the installation.
</p>

<p>
I downloaded the bugzilla 2.22 which is the latest stable version. And read
the QUICKSTART guide. I ran checksetup.pl repeatedly to look for uninstalled
CPAN modules, and installed them using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Ovid/">Ovid (the CPAN-to-RPM gateway, not Curtis "Ovid" Poe)</a> and rpm. Then
I set up a database.
</p>

<p>
I encountered a problem where Apache just displayed the code of the CGI scripts
instead of running them. This was resolved by uncommenting an Apache
directive from httpd.conf (it was pointed at the QUICKSTART guide by I
assumed it was OK on our server). Then I tried to login with the password
of the admin account. It did not work.
</p>

<p>
I changed the password, it did not work again. So I had to investigate. Turns
out that the code for crypting the password is the following:
</p>

<pre>
my @saltchars = (0..9, 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '.', '/');
my $salt = '';
for ( my $i=0 ; $i &lt; 8 ; ++$i ) {
    $salt .= $saltchars[rand(64)];
}
my $cryptedpassword = crypt($password, $salt);
</pre>

<p>
Now the rand() call is interesting. If we want it to be determinstic, than
either srand() should be called previously or we can assume it will yield
the same values on each invocation of Perl.
</p>

<p>
However, this happens:
</p>

<pre>
$ perl -le 'print int(rand(10))'
8
$ perl -le 'print int(rand(10))'
5
</pre>

<p>
And a grep for <tt>srand()</tt> on the bugzilla code yielded no result.
</p>

<p>
I added a call to srand() at the beginning of the module with a number I chose,
and then it worked.
</p>

<p>
I wonder why the call to srand() is absent, and its need is not documented
anywhere. There are also other possible problems with the portability of
<tt>rand()</tt> and <tt>crypt()</tt>. In order to not completely slander
bugzilla here, I'd like to add that except for the <tt>srand()</tt> issue,
setting up bugzilla was very straightforward, and starting to administrate
the bugs database was also a very pleasant experience. It truly is a fine,
powerful and easy to use and setup product.
</p>

<p>
I recall that in the early DOS and XT-ROM versions of BASIC, the random number
generator generated the same numbers on every invocation. Maybe that was
also the case for perl5, but it obviously no longer is, so I wonder how
come Bugzilla was not adapted yet.
