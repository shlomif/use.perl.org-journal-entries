I've been using the CPAN module
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Mail-Webmail-Gmail/">Mail-Webmail-Gmail</a>
to purge a certain folder in my gmail account for some time now. As a matter 
of fact, I was the one who 
<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=11836">suggested 
    the author to enable operations on more than one message at once</a>, 
so deleting several messages won't take for ever,
and will eventually cause gmail.com to temporarily ban you.
</p>

<p>
However, several months ago, a gmail.com interface change took place, and
as a result 
<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=14540">Mail-Webmail-Gmail 
    broke</a>. Eventually I was too annoyed with it that I ended up fixing it
myself, and submitted a patch to the CPAN Request Tracker. That was at 
11-January-2006.
</p>

<p>
The author was unresponsive, and tired of waiting for it to be applied, 
<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/47246">I asked the 
    CPAN gods to become a co-maintainer of the module</a>. They did not
reply. That was 06-February-2006.
</p>

<p>
Two weeks ago, I <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.perl.modules.authors/921">sent them a reminder and CCed it to module-authors@perl.org</a>.
I received many replies, among them <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.perl.modules.authors/929">one by brian d foy about the proper
    procedure</a>. In any case, the author of Mail-Webmail-Gmail chose that
exact date to upload a new version of Mail-Webmail-Gmail (two in fact - 1.04.1
and 1.05, that differ only in their version number.), and so all's well
that ends well.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Mail-Webmail-Gmail <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/dist/Mail-Webmail-Gmail">got a bad 
    review because it did not work</a>. Also, if you're wondering why you 
still need this module since Google is giving POP3 access - be aware that 
there are many operations that simply can't be done using POP3.
