<p>
Since the <a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/offers/o-and-m-2006-08/">Web-CPAN
    T-shirts giveaway</a> is not proving to be very popular among hackers,
I've had the idea of expanding its scope. Why not give an
<a href="http://www.ozyandmillie.org/">Ozy and Millie</a> T-shirt to the
first 4 hackers who resolve a long-standing
<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/">CPAN Request Tracker</a> bug, not necessarily a
web-cpan.berlios.de one?
</p>

<p>
Some ground rules I can think of:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
    The bug has to be last-standing. It should have been opened for at
    least a month.
    </li>
    <li>
    It has to be approved by the module's maintainer or otherwise real.
    </li>
    <li>
    The patch should include a regression testcase, and a fix to the code.
    </li>
    <li>
    The module should be fairly popular and useful instead of a very obscure
    and unused module.
    </li>
    <li>
    The author should accept the patch into his mainline repository before
    the T-Shirt can be ordered.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
I don't mind other people joining in with their own offers for the T-shirts
(or other gifts) pool, but I'm sticking with O&amp;M T-Shirts.
</p>

<p>
I've seen more than one CPAN modules with tens of open bugs in their Request
Tracker queue, and I think offering T-shirts may be a good way to
encourage people to get involved. So what do you all think? Is that a good
idea?
