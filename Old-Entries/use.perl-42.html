<p>
Today I was heavily immersed in
<a href="http://www.fonality.com/golf/">this new Perl Golf</a>, as
<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.golf/2407">reported by
    Ton Hospel</a>. It's sponsored by a company, and there are prizes for
the winners, but one need to fill in some contact details if you wish to
receive the prizes. It's still active, so I hope you enjoy it!

Due to it, I neglected <a href="http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/">my
    reading</a> to some extent.
