<p>
I recently released the first non-developer releases of the 
<a href="http://qa.yi.org/index.php/Test::Run">Test::Run</a> modules. I still
don't guarantee that everything is stable, but at least now one can fetch
them from CPAN with ease.
</p>

<p>
I got a few "Warning: prerequisite Test::Run::Obj 0 not found.", but hopefully
it is resolved now after I changed the <tt>$VERSION</tt> of the module itself
to a non-underscored one.
</p>

<p>
Next on my agenda is finishing the 
<tt>Test::Run::Plugin::FailSummaryComponents</tt> plugin, which still doesn't
have the appropriate command line front-end. I decided to abandon my original
if's upon if's plan and instead allow customisations using templates or
mini-templates. For this I decided a sprintf-like template only
with named conversions (e.g: <tt>"Hello %(name)s! Happy new %(year)d!"</tt>)
would be ideal. I could not find anything for this on CPAN, but 
<a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/typesseq-strings.html">Python has
    them</a>, so I'd like to prepare an equivalent Perl implementation and
put it on CPAN. 
</p>

<p>
After that I'd like to start getting to writing the XML/HTML output. My plans
for it are the following:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
    Write a plugin for Test::Run that will collect the relevant statistics 
    from the run (instead of just outputting them to the screen) and store 
    them in a Perl data structure.
    </li>

    <li>
    Write a plugin using it that at the end of the run will serialise the data 
    collected to XML.
    </li>

    <li>
    Write an XSLT stylesheet that will transform the XML to HTML.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
Lately, I've had to invest time in other priorities, and Test::Run has been
pretty low on my todo list, but hopefully I can return to it.
