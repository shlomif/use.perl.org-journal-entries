As <a href="http://use.perl.org/~Shlomi+Fish/journal/31651">promised</a>, I
wrote and released 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-Sprintf-Named/">Text-Sprintf-Named</a> 
onto the CPAN. This is an implementation of a Python-like sprintf with named
conversions. So you can do 
<tt>my $formatter = Text::Sprintf::Named-&gt;new({fmt =&gt; 'Hello %(name)s! You have $%(money)04d in your bank account!');</tt> 
and then 
<tt>$formatter-&gt;format({args =&gt; {name =&gt; "Joey", money =&gt; 350}})</tt>
and get 'Hello Joey! You have $0350 in your bank account!' in return.
</p>

Now that I look at its POD again I see that the code in the synopsis is wrong. 
I guess I'll have to release version 0.01001 soonishly. If you find
this module useful, that's good, and if not, I hope I haven't made your
situation any worse. I wrote it because I thought it may prove useful for 
a Test::Run plugin, so necessity was the mother of implementation in this
case.

Cheers all, and a Happy Thanksgiving to all Americans.
