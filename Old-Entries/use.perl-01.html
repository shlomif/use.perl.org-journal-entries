<p>
After learning some Ruby on Rails from the O'Reilly-Net tutorial, I went
over the <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2005/06/02/catalyst.html">Perl.com
    Catalyst Tutorial</a>. Then I decided that I'll write an application in
it in order to learn it better.
</p>
<p>
So I began to write it. It took me two or three days and right
now I only have a record display page, an edit form and an addition form
for one of the tables. Part of it is because I'm not very familiar with
Class::DBI and other technologies Catalyst is making use of.
Hopefully I'll become more familiar with everything as I invest more time.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, I discovered a misbehaviour in the Catalyst core: trailing slashes
in the PATH_INFO are ignored. So <tt>/myapp/path1/</tt> would be reported the
same as <tt>/myapp/path1</tt>. This may break a lot of relative URLs.
I traced the problem to a line containing
<code>split /\//, $c-&gt;req-&gt;path</code>, which throws away components
that are empty from the end. A Patch I wrote to change it to
<code>split /\//, $c-&gt;req-&gt;path, -1</code> <a href="http://www.loglibrary.com/show_page/view/141?Multiplier=3600&Interval=6&StartTime=1118148545">was
    rejected</a> after I was told some people may depend on this erroneous
behaviour.
</p>
<p>
I was instructed to write a Plugin instead, which I did. A problem I
encountered was that this call to split appeared right at the beginning of a
much larger function. I wrote another patch, to extract a method with this,
but it was rejected because they did not want to clutter the API.
</p>
<p>
Thus,
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Catalyst-Plugin-SanitizeUrl/">Catalyst-Plugin-SanitizeUrl</a>
has to duplicate the code of the function, extract a method out of it, and
then override this method. &lt;sigh /&gt; But it works&tm;.
