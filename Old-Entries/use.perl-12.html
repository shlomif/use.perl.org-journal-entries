<p>
As part of my ongoing effort to create a better web-based newsreader for
<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/">nntp.perl.org</a>, I'd like to take a
look at its current code, to learn exactly how things are done. (especially,
the RSS feeds generation).
</p>

<p>
However, I am unable to find out where to find this code. There used to be
a perl.org repository under svn.perl.org, with an account of guest, but
this account has been disabled (at least with the original password which
I was given and which I otherwise was able to find). I sent an email to the
Perl NOC guys (Ask Bj√∏rn Hansen and Robert Spier) about a week ago, but still
haven't received any reply from either (not even an acknowledgement). I tried
talking to Ask on Jabber (twice) but he did not respond.
</p>

<p>
So I'd like to query the knowledge and wisdom of the collective Perl community
about where I can find the source code for nntp.perl.org. If you can help,
please post a comment below. (Or otherwise
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/me/contact-me/">contact me</a>.)
</p>

<p>
As for some news about CGI-Application-NetNewsIface itself: I released the
first non-developers release on CPAN (version 0.0101), in order to help reach
the 10,000 CPAN modules barrier before YAPC::NA. Since then, I quite stopped
working on it (due to my new full-time job and a voluntary project I'm
involved in.) Yesterday and today however, I added support for a MySQL-based
cache (a very small code modification), and also added a front page, and an
"About this App" page. Both are in the Subversion repository.
</p>

<p>
I'd really like to add RSS-support next, which is why I'd like to take a look
at the code of www.nntp.perl.org.
