<p>
We're down to 18 bugs in
<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=XML-RSS">the
    XML-RSS queue</a>. As I went over them, I found quite a few duplicates.
</p>

<p>
I have two pending patches for two issues there, and on the other hand there
are still some bugs I did not examine at all.
</p>

<p>
I'm hopeful that I can do more work on the module, and with Ask Bj√∏rn Hansen's
help, have it incldued in the module. In case you haven't done so, you should
upgrade to XML-RSS 1.20 which is now on CPAN.
</p>

<p>
After we fix all the bugs (except perhaps for the wishlist ones), and in the
process add tests, we can continue to give the code the heavy refactoring
that it needs.
