Hi! This is the first time I make use of my "use Perl" web-log. I'm doing it
in order to raise an issue I encountered with the Perl IRC world. If you
participate in IRC discussions in Perl-related channels, please help spread
the word, or if you are knowledgeable enough comment below or
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/me/contact-me/">contact me</a>.
</a>
</p>
<p>
My IRC reputation in the Perl-related channels has become tarnished lately, I
don't know exactly why, and I'd like to get to the bottom of it. The first time
I encountered it was on January 22 this year. I logged in to irc.perl.org and
joined #perl in order to look for Mark Fowler (of the Perl Advent Calendar).
There someone named sungo said "rindolf: [that's my nick] are you who i think
you are.", and shortly afterward banned me from the channel. I tried to talk
with him, (using a dedicated /msg talk channel), but he told me that he doesn't
want to explain his actions to me, and that I shouldn't /msg him.
</p>
<p>
Two days ago, I joined irc.perl.org again, and wanted to ask a question in
#perl. (about CPAN smoking). The ban was still there. So I joined #poe and
asked if the ban could be lifted. Eventually it was, and I was able to get
the help I needed and then just stayed there without doing anything. When
sungo logged on a few hours later, and noticed I was there, he banned me again.
</p>
<p>
Now today, I logged into FreeNode's #perl, and Jonathan Scott Duff (a.k.a
PerlJam), told me:
</p>
<p>
<i>"For the past several days now your name has come up on the other #perls
    quite a bit  (usually in phrases like "If that rindolf guy shows up, I'll
    kick+ban him!" or "make sure rindolf is banned" etc.)  What did you do
    that's got people up in arms against you again?"</i>
</p>
<p>
And I honestly don't know. In the last days, I've hanged out mostly in
FreeNode, Moznet, and GimpNet, (with a couple of logins to irc.perl.org and to
OFTC). I did not mis-behave, and was not impolite or a troll. What caused
that?
</p>
<p>
I realize I wrote some essays in the past that evoked antagonism from some
parts of the Perl community. However that was quite a long time ago (the
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/1339/">Critique of Perl 6</a> was
published 6 months ago), and I did not brought them into discussions in the
IRC unless I was asked about them first. I also contributed some code,
documentation and help to perl, and open-source in general, so my karma cannot
be entirely negative.
</p>
<p>
Can anyone bring any evidence as to why I am mistreated this way, with no
fault of my own? Something is fishy here.
