Your mission should you choose to accept it: get my homesite and Test::Run
to run under perl-5.9.4, which is the latest development version of perl.

Mission accepted!

----------------------

Downloading perl-5.9.4.

    Bug: in http://www.cpan.org/src/README.html the latest is mentioned as
    perl-5.9.3 while perl-5.9.4 is already available.

### Since not all tests were successful, you may want to run some of
### them individually and examine any diagnostic messages they produce.
### See the INSTALL document's section on "make test".
### You have a good chance to get more information by running
###   ./perl harness
### in the 't' directory since most (>=80%) of the tests succeeded.
### You may have to set your dynamic library search path,
### LD_LIBRARY_PATH, to point to the build directory:
###   setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH `pwd`; cd t; ./perl harness
###   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH; cd t; ./perl harness
###   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`; cd t; ./perl harness
### for csh-style shells, like tcsh; or for traditional/modern
### Bourne-style shells, like bash, ksh, and zsh, respectively.

Tried again with bleadperl - worked this time.

-----------------

Ran "perl -MCPAN -e shell". 

It configured itself except for the urllist.

Tried to "install Test::Reporter". This asked me whether to follow the
pre-requisites.

Meanwhile, trying to install Term::ReadLine::Gnu
    - installation failed because libncurses.a was not present.
        - urpmi ncurses-devel
        - urpmi libreadline-devel

    - Fails with the following errors:
