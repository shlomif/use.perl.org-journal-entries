I've been stumped on an obscure problem while using
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-LibXML/">XML-LibXML</a>'s
XML::LibXML::Dtd. When trying to slurp the text of the DTD and call
<tt>XML::LibXML::Dtd-&gt;parse_string</tt> as documented in the POD document,
it still emitted an error. Now, I was including some DTD modules using
the <tt>SYSTEM</tt> directive inside the DTD.
</p>

<p>
As it turns out I should have done this to start with:
</p>

<code>
my $dtd =<br />
    XML::LibXML::Dtd-&gt;new(<br />
            "Products Syndication Markup Language 0.1.1",<br />
            "products-syndication.dtd",<br />
            );<br />
</code>

<p>
Call <tt>XML::LibXML::Dtd-&gt;new()</tt> with the docstring and the URL to
the DTD. After I changed the code to using it everything worked fine. Problem
is it is not documented anywhere in the POD. Guess I'll have to file a (yet
another) XML::LibXML bug and attach a patch to the POD. &lt;sigh /&gt; - more
work to do.
</p>

On a slightly differnet note if you want to learn XSLT, start at the
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/">W3Schools XSLT Tutorial</a> (which is
short and doesn't cover a lot of stuff, but still good) and proceed to the
<a href="http://www.zvon.org/xxl/XSLTutorial/Books/Book1/index.html">Zvon
    XSLT Tutorial</a> (which covers almost everything, but requires some
basic understanding.). Right now, I'd like to write an XSLT stylesheet (after
I finish with the DTD), and these two tutorials finally caused the XSLT
coin to fall.
