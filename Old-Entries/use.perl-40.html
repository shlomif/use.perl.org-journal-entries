<p>
Several people who are subscribed to the 
<a href="http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/boston-pm">Boston.PM mailing 
    list</a> decided to start an effort to 
<a href="http://perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2006-November/008322.html">create a 
    Perl Advent Calendar for this year</a>. (Also see 
<a href="http://perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2006-November/008330.html">this 
    sub-thread</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Since there isn't much time left we could use all the help we can get. If you
can help perform any of the tasks mentioned in the emails, please 
<a href="mailto:shlomif@iglu.org.il">send me an email</a> and I'll subscribe
you to the perladvent workers' mailing list. Hopefully, we can have a high 
quality and professional Perl Advent Calendar this year even if 
<a href="http://2shortplanks.com/">Mark Fowler</a> (who originated the 
Calendar and maintained the tradition for a few years) is missing in action.
