<p>
Ever since the Perl mailing lists web archive system got switched from
the old develooper format to <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/">the new
    one at www.nntp.perl.org</a>, I have been irritated from the lack of
threading and other navigation features that I came to expect from most
mail archives.
</p>

<p>
I contacted the perl.org administrators about it and as it turns out, the
interface used there is just a web-based newsreader. They wanted to keep it
this way, but still allow for better controls. I emailed them about writing
a better interface a long time ago, and got a reply for some requirements.
</p>

<p>
A few weeks ago, I got my act together, and started working on a better
web-based newsreader. After a few days of hacking, I came up with the
first working version of
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI-Application-NetNewsIface/">CGI-Application-NetNewsIface</a>,
which I uploaded to CPAN. Version 0.0100_01 contained most of the features
of the www.nntp.perl.org version except for RSS support.
</p>

<p>
In order to implement threading efficiently, I decided to implement a local
cache using the <a href="http://dbi.perl.org/">perl DBI</a> and
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBD-SQLite/">DBD-SQLite</a>. In the
process, I bugged the DBD-SQLite maintainer about two bugs I ran into in
the past and present. He fixed one of them, and one of them is luckily just
a warning, and one which I provided a patch to the sources for a way to
disable. (Which I'll hope will get applied.)
</p>

<p>
So, Version 0.0100_02 of CGI-Application-NetNewsIface which I uploaded to CPAN
today, (and which
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/code/perl/CGI-Application-NetNewsIface-0.0100_02.tar.gz">is
    temporarily available here</a>) displays the current thread in the active
message, which should be a huge improvement.
</p>

<p>
My goal is to make CGI-App-NNI a viable alternative for the current
www.nntp.perl.org web-interface, and as an NNTP web interface for
other sites that would like to implement similar interfaces. There is
still quite a lot to do, but it should be doable.
</p>

<p>
It would be nice if you try to set it up on your web server and let me know
if it works. Patches are also welcome, of course. (see the Subversion
repository). We waited too much for a decent web-interface to the Perl
mailing lists, and I don't want to wait much longer.
