<p>
I discovered 
<a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40995">a segfault</a>
in the perl-5.8.x compilation stage. I discovered it by accident: I was
refactoring some code, and added a function, and then it segfaulted. After
reducing the code to a minimal form that still exhibited the problem, I found 
it had a syntax error which triggered the segfault.
</p>

<p>
The following code when run by perl-5.8.x triggers the segfault:
</p>

<ecode>
sub
{
    my ($i, $j) = @_;
    sub { [ $i->f(); ] };
}
</ecode>

<p>
It doesn't segfault perl-5.6.2. Since it is also no longer exhibited in
bleadperl, it was closed as "resolved". However, I wrote the following on what
should still be done:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Add this as a test-case to the perl 5 test-suite.
</li>
<li>
Write a patch for the perl-5.8.x line. (Which is still heavily 
 used).
</li>
<li>
Investigate the crash, and see if it poses security risks. (Other than the
obvious DoS that is caused by the segfault of evaluating such code.)
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I hope it will be dealt with appropriately. And finally here's some IRC
conversation about this:
</p>

<ecode>
 <rindolf> Hi all.
 <rindolf> buu: can I try to crash buubot?
     <buu> rindolf: Be my guest. Just do it in #buubot
 <rindolf> buu: OK.

And later on on #buubot:

 <rindolf> Hi all.
    <MUBA> hi rindolf - the fun thing is, no-one so 
           far has been able to crash it :)
 <rindolf> MUBA: OK.
    <MUBA> at least not that I know of
 <rindolf> eval: sub func1{my ($i, $j) = @_; 
           sub { return [ $i->func2(); ]; };}
  <buubot> (eval):23: [BUG] Segmentation fault ruby 
           1.8.5 (2006-08-25) [i486-linux]  rindolf: 
 <rindolf> Hmmm... there was a segfault. I guess it forked 
           or something.
 <rindolf> eval: 5+6
  <buubot> rindolf:  11 
 <rindolf> buu: it's a perl bug I discovered.
     <buu> Of course it forks
     <buu> But nice segfault.
    <MUBA> I don't get the error... you make a sub that 
           returs a sub that returns the result of a method 
           on a non-initialized object inside an arrayref? 
           But you never call any of those? How can it crash?
 <rindolf> MUBA: it's in the compilation stage.
 <rindolf> MUBA: notice that I have [ $i->func2() ; ]. A 
           semicolon inside an array ref is illegal.
    <MUBA> ooh that is what causes the crash?
    <MUBA> eval: [3;
  <buubot> MUBA: Error: syntax error at eval line 1, at 
           EOF Missing right curly or square bracket at
           eval line 1, at end of line  
    <MUBA> eval: [3;]
  <buubot> MUBA: Error: syntax error at eval line 1, at 
           EOF  
    <MUBA> not that alone
 <rindolf> MUBA: no, it requires more sophisticated code.
</ecode>

<p>
"Nice segfault"... ;-)
