<p>
Well, after <a href="http://use.perl.org/~Shlomi+Fish/journal/29151">my 
    previous post about Error.pm</a>, I took the advice of some of the 
people who commented, and started my own development line where I fixed some
bugs that I found in the Error.pm request tracker. A few days ago I contacted
Graham Barr (who originated Error.pm) informed him of my branch and the 
original discussion and asked him to make me a co-maintainer. Yesterday, he 
replied, and said he did exactly that.
</p>

<p>
So I uploaded 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Error-0.15005/">Error-0.15005</a> to
CPAN, and it now can be found in search.cpan.org. Initially there was a problem,
where Barr made me a co-maintainer only of the "Error" package and not of 
"Error::Simple", and "Error::subs", which are also supplied by the
distribution, but he remedied that. (Distribution authors should make sure to
make their co-maintainers have co-maintainership of all the packages that
are contained in the CPAN distribution, to prevent such problems).

<p>
I'll release Error-0.16 after a few more Error-0.15\d\d\d releases, which will
fix the remaining problems as reported in 
<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=Error">the Error.pm 
    request tracker queue</a>. I hope there won't be any problems for me to
close the bugs there. If you have any bug reports or suggestions for new
features don't hesitate to put it there and I'll deal with it.
</p>

<p>
Happy Erroring!
