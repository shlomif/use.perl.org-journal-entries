<p>
One bug that kept annoying me with the perl debugger, was that sometimes in
the middle of debugging a program, the content of the current line stopped
appearing. Recently, I was able to reproduce it with an XML::RSS test file,
and decided to investigate.
</p>

<p>
I delved into the debugger internals and found that it gets the contents of
the file from a variable called <tt>@{main::_&lt;myfile.pl}</tt> (which
as I found out was populated for it by the perl interpreter). And as it
turned out, by printing this value within the debugger after I reproduced
the problem, I got a small number of completely different lines. I searched 
for them in the perl source tree, and found they belonged inside an 
<tt>eval ""</tt>  call in a Test::Builder function. And as I saw this eval 
call had a <tt>#line myfile.pl</tt> directive.  And writing a short program 
which did an eval with such a line as its filename reproduced the bug in a 
self-contained form.
</p>

<p>
So 
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-11/msg00415.html">I
    reported this bug</a>. I eventually found out (by grepping the perl 5
source) that it 
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-11/msg00481.html">was 
    caused by some code that was added to toke.c</a> between perl 5.8.7 and
perl 5.8.8, and which was disabled in a Perl using ithreads support.
Then <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-11/msg00493.html">RGS 
    fixed the bug</a> (at least in bleadperl now).
</p>

<p>
But he didn't add a regression test. Since I had an idea for writing such a 
test, I
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-11/msg00531.html">wrote one and sent it along</a>. It still is not ready for inclusion into
the perl 5 core, because it does not follow the conventions of the tests 
there. But it's a start.
</p>

<p>
Happy debugging!
