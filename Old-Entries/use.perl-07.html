<p>
I'd like to ask the help of the "use Perl;" readers in trying to regain
maintenance of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Error/">the Error.pm
CPAN module</a>, which provides object-oriented exception-handling in Perl 5.
</p>

<p>
The module has been unmaintained since October 2001 (over 4 years ago) and
has <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Error">six
registered bugs</a> in the CPAN bugtracker, one of them 2 years old.
</p>

<p>
I've tried to contact <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~uarun/">the 
maintainer</a> 
through his Yahoo and Hotmail E-mail addresses six days ago. One address 
bounced, and I've yet to hear from the other. One should note that the last
of his module updates was at December, 2002.
</p>

<p>
If you know how to reach the maintainer, please comment here and give me some
help. Else, I request the CPAN gods to give me (or a more suitable volunteer) a
co-maintainership of the module, so I can fix the bugs, and continue to 
maintain it.
</p>
