<p>
I publicised <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/work/private-lessons/">the 
    fact that I'm giving Private Lessons</a> on my home site. I've been
contacted several times from potential pupils, but nothing materialised.
Until this week, when someone contacted me about me giving him private
lessons in Perl.
</p>

<p>
He is a soon-to-be <a href="http://www.idc.ac.il/">Interdisciplinary
    Center</a> graduate, who got a job doing QA in Perl, so he wanted to
learn it for his job. I gave him an hour lesson on Tuesday and Wednesday,
and a three hour lesson on Thursday. I think it went pretty well, and I was
able to convey a lot of the important material. He is an intelligent guy,
but still a bit clueless in stuff that I've taken for granted for a long time.
</p>

<p>
For his work he needs to learn parsing and writing to excel files, extracting
data out of XML files, and interacting with the web. So I taught him
XML::LibXML, LWP and other stuff. The lesson on Thursday dealt with XML and it
took a long time due to the fact that he didn't know too much about XML and
I needed to explain a lot of stuff.
</p>

<p>
To sum up, for me it was a fun and mentally rewarding experience and I also
got some money in return. I hope there will be more opportunities like that.
