<p>
We'd like to make a conclusion of 
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/advocacy%40perl.org/msg02008.html">the 
    recent discussion on advocacy@perl.org</a> about a central wiki for
Perl. First of all, <a href="http://perl.net.au/">perl.net.au</a> by the
Australian Perl Mongers, was voluntereed as an ad-hoc central MediaWiki
instance for the Perl world. A different volunteer registered 
<a href="http://perl.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page">perl.wikia.com</a> at 
Wikia (a community MediaWiki-hosting formerly known as WikiCities). At the
moment, it simply refers to perl.net.au.
</p>

<p>
Finally, Ask Bj√∏rn Hansen 
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/advocacy%40perl.org/msg02012.html">said
he'd like to set up a Socialtext-based wiki once it is released as beta and
he "would play with it"</a> at possibly wiki.perl.org. However, meanwhile,
one should probably work on perl.net.au instead.
</p>

<p>
One should note that <a href="http://use.perl.org/~merlyn/">merlyn</a> 
claims he suggested the idea of a central wiki for Perl (at Wikia) back in
August 2005, so he also deserves some credit.
</p>

<p>
Happy central-perl-wiki-ing!
